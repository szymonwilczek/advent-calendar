# Advent Calendar

A project created as a gift for my girlfriend. I wanted to create something original, something memorable and do it in something I am good at. 
The official version includes a few goodies, but this version is included as an open-source project without a license, so if you have a better idea 
for modifying the advent calendar than I had when creating it, go ahead and create a commit or create your own project. 
**Just be sure to tag in credit if you would like to use it already.**
